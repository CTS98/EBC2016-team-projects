/*The Fibonacci numbers are an integer sequence deﬁned as follows: F 0 = 0, F 1 = 1, and F n = F n−2 + Fn−1
for every n ≥ 2. The beginning of the sequence is therefore 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.
Write a program Fibonacci that takes a positive integer n as input and outputs the value of F n .
Experiment a bit to see what the largest value of n is so that you can compute F n .
