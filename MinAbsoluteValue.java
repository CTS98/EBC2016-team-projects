        Write two methods minAbsoluteValueLinear and minAbsoluteValueBinary.
        Both methods take as input a sorted array of integer values and return
        the smallest absolute value of the entries in the array. The ﬁrst method
        should go through the whole array from the ﬁrst to the last element, while
         the second method should use binary search.

        Write a program that can generate random sorted integer arrays and that can test
        and compare the runtimes of the two methods above for arrays of varying length. */
